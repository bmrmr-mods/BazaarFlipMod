# bmrmr's Bazaar Flipping Mod

This mod can be used to effortlessly calculate bazaar flips in Hypixel Skyblock. 

This mod requires Minecraft 1.8.9 Forge. 

The mod uses the Hypixel API to obtain Bazaar prices in real time and finds the profitable flips among thousands of possibilities. 

## Example usage 

The command to run the calculation is /bzflips. 

###Understanding the output

Let's do the top flip listed on the screenshot below. 

128x STRONG_MANA level 3 to level 10 profit 1555712 cost 28444288

You should buy 128x level 3 Strong Mana Enchanted books from Bazaar for 28,444,288 coins, combine them into a level 10 book using an anvil, and sell it to Bazaar for 1,555,712 coins profit.

## Warnings

My mod does not know the tax that you are paying to Bazaar, therefore the actual profit will be a little bit less than the estimated profit. 
If you buy a lot of books (32 or more), the price might increase for the last books you are buying. For that reason you might pay more than the estimated cost. 
I am not responsible if you lose money (Buying the wrong books or not paying attention to actual buy or sell prices).
